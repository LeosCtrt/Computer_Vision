# Brain Tumor Segmentation

This is a personnal project. The goal was to perform segmentation on brain tumors MRI. The link of the dataset is here : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mateuszbuda/lgg-mri-segmentation.

For the model I went for a U-net architecture, and I used the implementation I did on my small other project. I acheived a 97% DICE score with very good results.
